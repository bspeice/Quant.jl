# Quant.jl

Quant.jl is intended to be something of a helper application: so many
times the same functions are re-written over and over, and it would
be helpful to standardize the implementation.

Currently implemented functionality:
  - Black-Scholes Call and Put calculation

Coming soon:
  - Greeks calculation
  - Brownian Motion simulation
  - Geometric Brownian Motion simulation
